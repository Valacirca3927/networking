## Foundation

Each router in an area will have an identical `LSDB` Link state database. OSPF is two-tier, there is the backbone area `0`, and other areas have connectivity to the backbone.

## Neighbor State Machine

**Down** - The initial state of a neighbor conversation indicates that no Hellos have been 
heard from the neighbor in the last RouterDeadInterval. Hellos are not sent to down 
neighbors unless those neighbors are on NBMA networks; in this case, Hellos are sent 
every PollInterval. If a neighbor transitions to the Down state from some higher state, 
the link state Retransmission, Database Summary, and Link State Request lists are 
cleared. 

**Attempt** - This state applies only to neighbors on NBMA networks, where neighbors 
are manually configured. A DR-eligible router transitions a neighbor to the Attempt 
state when the interface to the neighbor first becomes Active or when the router is the 
DR or BDR. A router sends packets to a neighbor in Attempt state at the HelloInterval 
instead of the PollInterval. 

**Init** - This state indicates that a Hello packet has been seen from the neighbor in the 
last RouterDeadInterval, but two-way communication has not yet been established. A 
router includes the Router IDs of all neighbors in this state or higher in the Neighbor 
field of the Hello packets.

**2-Way** - This state indicates that the router has seen its own Router ID in the 
Neighbor field of the neighborâ€™s Hello packets, which means that a bidirectional 
conversation has been established. On multi-access networks, neighbors must be in 
this state or higher to be eligible to be elected as the DR or BDR. The reception of a 
Database Description packet from a neighbor in the init state also causes a transition 
to 2-Way. 

**ExStart** - In this state, the router and its neighbor establish a master/slave relationship 
and determine the initial DD sequence number in preparation for the exchange of 
Database Description packets. The neighbor with the highest Router ID becomes the 
master. 

**Loading** - The router sends Link State Request packets to neighbors that are in 
the Loading state, requesting more recent LSAs that have been discovered in the 
Exchange state but have not yet been received. 

**Full** - Neighbors in this state are fully adjacent, and the adjacencies appear in Router 
LSAs and Network LSAs.

[Via the RFC :)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2328#section-10.8)

#### Hello Packet

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- | 
| Router ID | 32 bits. Usually an IP, Usually the loopback0 |
| Auth Options | `none`, `clear text`, `MD5` |
| Area ID | 32 bits. Can be in IP or just decimal. |
| Interface Address Mask | Subnet mask of the interface the hello is sent on |
| Interface Priority | What priority this interface is for a DR election |
| Hello Interval | Seconds between hello packets |
| Dead Interval | How long to wait in seconds before delaring a router down | 
| DR and BDR | IPs of the DR and BDR |
| Active Neighbor | List of neighbors seen on the network segment, within the Dead Interval | 

### LSAs

Default OSPF routing preference

intra-area > inter-area > external > nssa-external


OSPF LSA Type | Purpose | Notes
--- | --- | ---
1 | Locally Connected | Router
2 | Broadcast DR | Subnet
3 | ABR Summary | Inter-Area
4 | ASBR Summaries | - 


#### NSSA

`N` for NSSA

This is for an attached domain that isn't running OSPF, you want to redistribute into the domain, without allowing other Type 5s. 
The new LSA is type 7. Instead of E1 and E2 its N1 and N2.


##### Getting a default into a NSSA

- `area 2 nssa default-information-originate` 
- `area 2 default-cost 500`

Doesn't happen by default.

#### Totally Stubby

`area 3 stub no-summary`
- only done on the ABR
- filters out even inter-area routes

## Orginating a Default Route

OSPF has two ways of originating a default route.

`default-information originate` if a default route is present.

`default-information originate always` do it anyway.

## Authentication
	
#### Signing

1. OSPF builds the packet.
1. Sending router picks primary key
    - 8 bit key ID which specifies the hash and shared secret
1. Crytographic sequence number is added for replay protection (Typically seconds since boot)
1. Secret is appended to the packet
1. Router uses the packet and secret to hash the packet, replacing the secret with the hash
1. Packet gets transmitted

#### Verifying signature
1. Look at the Key ID
1. Hash the packet minus the pre-existing hash using the Key.
1. If it matches, verify the crypto sequence number is higher.
1. Accept.

| `ip ospf network point-to-multipoint` | point-to-multipoint	  | Multicast		        | 1 - No DR		    |   Frame-relay with a Hub router. Uses more resources then NBMA, more fault tollerant  |

[^NBMA]: Only John Moy understands this. It's very difficult to troubleshoot, but it is the RFC compliant (??) implementation. Use `ip ospf network point-to-multipoint`.
[^unicast]: The DR (which should be the HUB or bad things happen) needs to have static neighbor statements.

### Sham Link

**The Problem**

A customer with L3VPN service via OSPF-BGP-VPNv4 decides to connect two sites together via OSPF backdoor, a direct connection they manage themselves.<br>
When they turn on their private OSPF peering, all the traffic between these two sites now prefers the new link, vs the L3VPN cloud.

How can the environment be changed so traffic preferes the L3VPN but uses the OSPF backdoor link when the VPN is down? 

**The Solution: Sham Links**

Sham links are needed because the routes provided by an L3VPN are `O IA`. When the OSPF backdoor link comes up it will be preferred for two reasons:
* OSPF has a lower AD than BGP.
* `O` routes are prefered over `O IA`

A sham link makes two PE routers at different sites in the same customer VRF form an intra-area connection. 

From [OSPF Sham-Link Support for MPLS VPN - Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/iproute_ospf/configuration/15-sy/iro-15-sy-book/iro-sham-link.html#GUID-B0CBC9E8-D423-4AEF-BAB4-15FED3EA486C).

> Before you create a sham-link between PE routers in an MPLS VPN, you must:
>
> * Configure a new interface with a /32 address on the remote PE so that OSPF packets can be sent over the VPN backbone to the remote end of the sham-link. The /32 address must meet the following criteria:
>   * Belong to a VRF
>   * Not be advertised by OSPF
>   * Be advertised by BGP
>   * You can use the /32 address for other sham-links

###### R1 Config

###### R2 Config

```

#### Virtual Links

> the [OSPF Virtual Link](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/open-shortest-path-first-ospf/47866-ospfdb7.html) is slightly different, in ospf each are must connect to the backbone 0 directly and in real world scenarios this is not always possible so the virtual links allows you to bridge across another ospf are to connect to area 0
