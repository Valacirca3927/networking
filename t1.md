## T1 Framing

D4 Frame is 24 timeslots + framing bit.

```
100011011100

Ethernet II --  14 octets.
MPLS        --   4 octets.
CESoPSN     --   4 octets.
TDM Payload -- 192 octets.

Each Ethernet II frame takes up 1712 bits on the wire.

T1 Channel Associated Signaling (CAS) [Used for voice]
    Every 6th frame will have all the lowest order bits stolen on each channel for signaling information.
    Super Framing does this 6 (A bit), 12 (B bit), 18 (A bit), 24 (B bit)
    Extended Super Framing does this but makes four bits. A, B, C, D

### Link Down

On RX
- 175 contigouse pulse positions with no positive or negative polarity.
   
On TX 
- Sends `yellow alarm` Far End Alarm
- Next device downstream gets a `blue alarm`

On this device marks the link as `T1 LOS` Loss of Signal.
