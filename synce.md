SyncE synchronizes clock frequency over an Ethernet port. It does not synchronize time-of-day, that's done by PTP, IEEE 1588.

Setting as oscilator to a frequency is syntonization.

## Terms

Synchronous Ethernet and IEEE 1588 in Telecoms

* **Time Interval** - Distance between two events, (measured in seconds), milliseconds, microseconds, nanoseconds, picoseconds

* **Frequency** - Rate of a repetitive event. Measured in cyles per second. A device that produces frequency is an oscilator.

* **T0** - System Clock (line interface output)
	
* **T1** - Timing Reference signal derived from STM-N (STS-N/SyncE) input.
	 
* **T2** - Timing Reference signal derived from 2048/1544 kbit input [input from PDH]
	
* **T3** -Timing reference signal derived from 2048 or 2048 1544 with SSM.
	 
* **T4** - Clock-interface output.

* **OSC** - Internal ST3 oscillator

* **SSM**  - Synchronization Status Message

* **ESMC**  -  Ethernet Synchronization Message Channel

* **MTIE** - Maximum time interval error is a measure of the worst case phase variation of a signal with respect to a perfect signal over a given period of time.

* **TDEV** - Time deviation is a statistical analysis of the phase stability of a signal over a given period of time.
